# CS210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project helps you to see what your returns would be based on different investment varriables. I felt like i did a pretty good job getting it to look and functions correctly. 
I would have really liked to have broken the code up better than I did. I think that I could have put functions in classes and made the main a lot shorter. It took me awhile to 
get the format looking the way I wanted, and I wanted to make sure that I had function before breaking it up. I just ran out of time to do more work on it. 
This was a good project for learning how to get the output looking correct and also math functions needed to work correctly which was good pratice.
I think that most people looking at the code should be able to read what is going on, and maintain it easily.
